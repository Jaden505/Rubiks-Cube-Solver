# Rubiks-Cube-Solver

The Rubiks cube is a list based rubiks cube of shape 6x3x3 where there are 6 face, 3 rows per face and 3 nodes per row.

The AI is an deep q network trained on the one-hot encoded state of the cube and outputs an action to take to solve the cube.

The training results are very promising, but unfortunatly I don't have the hardware to fully train the model, it would take me several days.
